# Sonar
# Suppose there is war going on between two countries and the enemy country has planted mines under the ocean. We now have to identify the mine and deactivate it. For this we are going to use SONAR and investigate using Machine Learning technique.
# SONAR is a devise which uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance, direction and speed of the object and help mariners to investigate about the object.
The data is Supervised which deals with classification problem.
The classes are:Mine and Rock
There are 208 rows and 61 columns, where 'Class' is considered to be the target variable.
We use Logistic regression, Svm and Naive Bayes algorithm and based on accuracy score we conclude that Logistic Regression Algorithm is better to use.
